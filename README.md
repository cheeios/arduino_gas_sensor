# Gas Detection System

This project monitors gas levels using an analog sensor connected to an Arduino, displays the reading on an I2C LCD, and sends SMS alerts using a SIM800L module when the gas level is above a certain threshold.

## Overview

We started with an **older code version** that functioned but had several issues:
- It risked sending repeated SMS messages (SMS spamming).
- It had a global and local variable conflict.
- It did not clamp negative gas values.
  
The **new version** resolves these issues by:
- Introducing a `dangerSent` flag to avoid repeated SMS alerts.
- Cleaning up variable scopes.
- Clamping gas level calculations to avoid negative readings.
- Adding more comprehensive comments for maintainability.

## Older Code Summary

The older code did the following:

- **Initialized** the LCD using `lcd.begin()` and `lcd.backlight()`.
- Used **SoftwareSerial** on pins 9 (RX) and 10 (TX) to communicate with the SIM800L module.
- In the `setup()` function:
  - Displayed a startup message on the LCD.
  - Sent basic AT commands to the SIM800L for initialization.
- In the `loop()` function:
  - Read from the gas sensor using `analogRead()`.
  - Calculated a gas value, displayed it on the LCD, and turned on a buzzer if the reading was high.
  - Called `SendTextMessage()` **every time** the threshold was exceeded, causing potential SMS spam.
- The `SendTextMessage()` function attempted to send an SMS with “Gas Leaking!” and then waited briefly.
- The `sendATCommand()` function was used to handle AT commands and print responses.

## Key Issues in the Older Code

1. **Variable Overshadowing**  
   A global `int gasvalue;` overshadowed the local variable `int gasvalue = ...;` in `loop()`. This could cause confusion or misuse of data.

2. **Repeated SMS Sending**  
   If the gas level stayed above the threshold, the loop would continuously call `SendTextMessage()`, resulting in multiple SMS messages within seconds.

3. **Negative Gas Values**  
   The formula `(analogSensor - 50) / 10` could produce negative values if `analogSensor` was below 50, which was not handled.

4. **LCD Library Differences**  
   Depending on the installed LiquidCrystal_I2C library, some require `lcd.init()` rather than `lcd.begin()`. This could lead to initialization errors for some users.

## New Code Summary

The **new code** addresses the above points:

1. **Single Scope for `gasvalue`**  
   Removed the global `gasvalue`, ensuring only the local variable in `loop()` is used.

2. **SMS Throttling**  
   Introduced a `dangerSent` boolean flag. It is set to `true` when an SMS is first sent upon detecting a dangerous gas level. Until the gas level goes back below the threshold, no new SMS is sent.

3. **Clamped Gas Reading**  
   Used `(raw < 50) ? 0 : (raw - 50) / 10;` so the gas reading won’t be negative.

4. **Added Comments**  
   More descriptive comments are present throughout the code, making it easier to understand and maintain.

5. **LCD Initialization Note**  
   Provided reminders to use either `lcd.init()` or `lcd.begin()` based on the library’s requirements.

## Improvements in the New Code

1. **Clearer Logic**  
   Eliminating shadowed variables reduces confusion. Each variable has a single purpose.

2. **No Spamming**  
   The `dangerSent` flag ensures only one SMS alert is sent while the system is in a “danger” state. This prevents large phone bills or user annoyance.

3. **Handling Sensor Edge Cases**  
   Clamping negative values helps avoid confusing displays and logic when sensor values are very low.

4. **Commented Code**  
   Each section of the code is annotated, aiding future development or troubleshooting.

5. **Greater Library Compatibility**  
   Stating `lcd.init()` vs `lcd.begin()` clarifies potential library discrepancies. If your display shows nothing, try using `lcd.init()` if your library requires it.

## Conclusion

With these changes, the gas detection system becomes more robust and user-friendly. Be sure to consider:

- **Power Requirements**: SIM800L can draw up to 2A spikes. Confirm your power supply can handle this.
- **Sensor Calibration**: Each gas sensor may have its own warm-up and calibration needs.
- **Further Enhancements**: You might log readings to an SD card, implement Wi-Fi updates, or add failsafes over time.
